Hi, I’m @Vikramansen, I am interested in developing and understanding machine learning to extract insights from digital data in high-impact domains, including healthcare. I am currently studying the challenges that arise from the application of deep learning to clinical data. I am learning more about CNNs and supervised learning’s applications.


As my previous account was compramised and used to create many junk repositories, I have decided to create a new profile. I will use this new account for all my new projects and I add all my old projects as well.
